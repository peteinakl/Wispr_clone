# FlowType

**AI-powered voice-to-text dictation for any text field on any website.**

FlowType is a Chrome extension that enables seamless voice-to-text transcription using OpenAI's Whisper AI (via Replicate API) with optional Claude AI text refinement. Simply press a keyboard shortcut, speak, and watch your words appear in any text field—automatically refined and polished if you enable intelligence features.

---

## 📖 Usage

1. **Navigate to any webpage** with a text field (Gmail, Google Docs, Notion, etc.)
2. **Click into a text field** to focus it
3. **Press the keyboard shortcut**:
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + Space`
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + Space`
4. **A floating indicator appears** in the bottom-right showing recording status
5. **Speak your text** clearly
6. **Press the shortcut again** to stop and transcribe
7. The transcribed text will be inserted at your cursor position

### Supported Text Fields

- `<input type="text">` elements
- `<textarea>` elements
- Standard `contenteditable` divs

### ✅ Confirmed Working Sites

- Gmail (compose, reply)
- Slack (messages, threads)
- Twitter/X (tweets, replies)
- Reddit (posts, comments)
- Notion (pages, databases)
- Discord (messages)
- Linear (issues, comments)
- GitHub (issues, comments, PRs)
- Most standard web forms and text inputs

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

**Does NOT work with complex rich text editors:**
- ❌ Google Docs
- ❌ Microsoft 365 Word Online
- ❌ Google Sheets (cells)

**Why?** These applications use custom-built editor frameworks with their own rendering engines, not standard HTML elements. They require deep integration with editor-specific APIs. FlowType works with ~90% of websites that use standard text inputs.

### Visual Feedback

The floating indicator shows these states:
- **Recording**: Red waveform animation with live duration counter
- **Processing**: Blue spinner while transcribing with Whisper (5-15 seconds)
- **Refining**: Purple spinner while Claude refines the text (2-5 seconds, only if Claude API key configured)
- **Error**: Red alert with error message

### Architecture

```
User presses shortcut
    ↓
Service Worker (receives keyboard command)
    ↓
Creates Offscreen Document (if needed)
    ↓
Offscreen: Requests microphone permission & starts MediaRecorder
    ↓
Service Worker → Content Script: Show floating indicator (RED waveform)
    ↓
User speaks and presses shortcut again
    ↓
Offscreen: Stops recording, returns audio blob as base64
    ↓
Service Worker: Sends audio to Replicate Whisper API
    ↓
Service Worker → Content Script: Update indicator (BLUE spinner "Processing")
    ↓
Service Worker: Polls for transcription result (60 attempts, 1s intervals)
    ↓
[If Claude API key configured]
    ↓
Service Worker → Content Script: Update indicator (PURPLE spinner "Refining")
    ↓
Service Worker: Sends transcription to Claude API for refinement
    ↓
Service Worker: Receives refined text (filler words removed, improved punctuation)
    ↓
[End conditional]
    ↓
Service Worker → Content Script: Send final text
    ↓
Content Script: Inserts text at saved cursor position
```

### After Making Changes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension won't load
- Ensure you selected the `dist/` directory, not the project root
- Check that the build completed without errors
- Verify you're running Chrome 91+

### Microphone permission issues
1. **System Level (Mac)**:
   - System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone
   - Ensure "Google Chrome" is checked

2. **Browser Level**:
   - Open FlowType popup
   - Click "Grant Microphone Access"
   - A new tab will open
   - Click the button and allow permission when prompted

3. **If permission was denied**:
   - Go to `chrome://settings/content/microphone`
   - Check if `chrome-extension://` is blocked
   - Remove from blocked list and try again

### Recording not starting
- Verify microphone permission is granted (see above)
- Check service worker console: `chrome://extensions/` → "service worker" link
- Ensure no other app is using your microphone

### Text not inserting
- Make sure the text field is focused when you start recording
- Check that the field is editable (not disabled or readonly)
- Open page console (F12) to see content script logs

### Transcription errors
- Verify your Replicate API key is valid
- Check you have API credits: [replicate.com/account](https://replicate.com/account)
- Network issues: ensure you have internet connection

### Debugging

**Service Worker logs:**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click "service worker" link under FlowType
3. Opens DevTools for background script

**Content Script logs:**
1. Right-click on any webpage → Inspect
2. Open Console tab
3. Look for `[Content]` prefixed messages

**Popup logs:**
1. Right-click extension icon → Inspect popup
2. Opens DevTools for popup

## 🎨 Design Features

### Visual Design
- **Dynamic waveform visualization** during recording
- **Refined glassmorphism** with backdrop blur effects
- **Smooth micro-interactions** and state transitions
- **Live duration counter** showing recording time

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- **No data storage**: Audio is processed via Replicate API and immediately discarded

- **Microphone access**: Only active during recording sessions
- **Optional AI refinement**: Transcribed text sent to Claude API only if you configure a Claude API key
- **Data retention**:
  - Replicate: Audio processed and discarded immediately
  - Anthropic (Claude): API data not used for training, 30-day retention policy
- **Open source**: All code is available for review
